# NostrTwentyNine - Nip29 focused relay written in Swift/Vapor

### Here be dragons ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
This repo is a work in progress and not ready for use and likely will not work. I would not even try it at the moment. I setup the repo simply to keep track of my work and for transparency such that my work can verified and followed.

Currently configs and database connection hard-coded so you'd have to play around with these if your setup is not the same as what I have.

#### Single Command Docker + https domain

If you want to get up and running quick you can run the following command on a fresh Ubunut/Debain/Fedora server.

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Galaxoid-Labs/NostrTwentyNine/main/setup.pl -o setup.pl && chmod +x setup.pl && ./setup.pl`

As always its important to inspect commands run from the internet. You can take a look at the perl script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Galaxoid-Labs/NostrTwentyNine/main/setup.pl)
